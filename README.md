# <div align="center"> Rails Engine

## Description
"Rails Engine" is an API that I created that allows us to see a merchant, a customer, an invoice, a transaction, items and an invoice item which all come together to make an api that shows you merchants transactions, they items they sell with the price and quantity they sold to their customers. It allows us to peek inside the merchants numbers to see how much revenue a specific merchant made or all together.

Rails Engine is an Api created from scratch which is new to me and uses CRUD functionality. Users can consume the Api to grab information from a specific merchant or many merchants and as well as see there items that each merchant sells. Users can aslo create, update or even delete an item or merchant to there liking.

Students worked remotely over 10 days using Slack, Zoom, Github, and Github projects. Test-driven development drove the creation of the app with tests written in RSpec.
